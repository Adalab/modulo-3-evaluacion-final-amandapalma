This is my **Rick & Morty character browser**, done as an evaluation exercise in [Adalab](https://adalab.es/).

The project consists of developing a web application to filter and find the information related to the characters of Rick & Morty comic / serie. Other functionalities are also added. Take a look and discover them!

The web application is developed with :crystal_ball: [React](https://reactjs.org/), and stylized with :sparkles: [CSS-Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). 

**I hope you enjoy it!**
